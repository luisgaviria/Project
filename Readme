This is a template site based on the picture provided as an example.

I developed this app on Codesanbox. 

You can run it either on Codesanbox or by uploading it to your machine and running yarn install.

The start command is npm start. 

You can then visit localhost 3000 to see it online.

Codesanbox will not run this site on a mobile device. You must run it on a computer with Codesanbox.

You can preview the site on a mobile device at https://bowst-project.herokuapp.com/
